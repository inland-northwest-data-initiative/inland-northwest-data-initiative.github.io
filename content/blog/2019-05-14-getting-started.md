After a [meeting of the Inland Northwest R User Group on the 27th of April](https://www.meetup.com/Inland-Northwest-R-User-Group-INRUG/events/260511697/), some of us hung around and started a discussion regarding the "grander" ideas for how we could work together to expand the impact of a culture of using data for solving social problems. We came up with a list of objectives and how we could address them. This initiative is a result of that discussion. Subsequent discussions on slack lead to the decision regarding a domain name, GitHub handle, and the template for the website. 

Another meeting took place on the 11th of May in Jepson 120. At that meeting, the website template was agreed upon and further refinements of the strategies to achieve our goals were made. 

This will be updated as progress is made ...
