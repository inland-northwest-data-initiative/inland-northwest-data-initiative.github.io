<h4> The Inland Northwest Data Initiative aims to make conversations about the use of data to address social issues more frequent. The initiative will focus on the Greater Spokane Area of Eastern Washington and North Idaho. In order to accomplish this broad objective, we hope to engage with the community using multiple means. Some of them include blogging, conducting data analysis competitions, meetups, hackathons, and consulting with businesses, non-profit organizations, and public policy makers.
